# Maze-Generator

#Controls
by clicking '1' on your keyboard when in the pygame window a new maze will be generated each time.

#notes
This is not the best code, it could defiantly be better but this is just for testing and some algorithm practice. Also the algorithm used in this is one i made. Bassicly it randomly picks a cell out of all the active cells. It then randomly picks a nogbor of that cell and draws the wall that intesects or that the 2 nighbors share.
